    "# The purpose of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a more organized, modular, \n",

    "\n",
    "# Here are some key purposes and advantages of using OOP in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "# a) Modularity: OOP allows us to break down a large program into smaller, manageable parts called objects. \n",
    "#     Each object can be independently developed, tested, and maintained, leading to more modular and reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# b) Encapsulation: OOP promotes the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data \n",
    "#     within a single unit, known as a class. This encapsulation helps in hiding the internal complexity of an object\n",
    "#     and prevents unauthorized access to its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# c) Inheritance: OOP supports inheritance, where a class (subclass) can inherit attributes and methods from \n",
    "#     another class (superclass). This promotes code reuse and enables us to create hierarchical relationships among classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# d) Polymorphism: OOP enables polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
    "#     This concept allows for flexibility in programming and facilitates code that can work \n",
    "#     with various object types without needing to know their specific classes."
